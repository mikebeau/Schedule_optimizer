Our project allows users to input the courses they want to take next semester at bu. 
It then asks for their preferences and our code will optimize their "perfect" class schedule.
It is set out to make student's lives easier come registration time.

To create a project similar to ours, you would need to retrive BU course data. After you need to 
decide how to sort your data to interact with your code. The UI needs to be compatible with your
data types. The optimization code is on a point assignment system based on preferences.
